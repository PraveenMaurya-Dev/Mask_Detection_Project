# Mask_Detection_Project

As the coronavirus is spreading rapidly, the WHO has suggested to maintain social distance and to wear facemask. in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease, i motivated to generate new insights, by providing information about people who don't wear facemask, using deep learning techniques, the technology i use was keras/Tensor flow and dataset i download from kaggle to train and build model to use has dataset for detection.


1- To run project first you have to download anaconda and then create environment for the project
2- Now you have to add required library in environment. 
3- After that you have to create model of dataset which is provide in files
4- To do that execute in terminal of python( python train_mask_detector.py)
5- After model is create now just execute by running command(python detect_mask_video.py)
